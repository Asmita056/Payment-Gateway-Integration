                <p>
                    The Giving Tree is an NGO in India headquartered in Mumbai.Our goals are to improve the health,
                    economic, social and spiritual conditions of the men, women and children we serve. Since the
                    founding, we has distributed more than 10,000 tractor-trailer loads of aid to the poor. We have also
                    built more than 9,000 housing units for people desperately in need of adequate shelter, and
                    completed more than 2,965 water projects that provide lifesaving water and sanitation to hundreds of
                    thousands of people in need. Our work is motivated by our faith in God, spreading His unconditional
                    love, regardless of race, wealth, or creed as we minister to those in desperate need.By providing
                    lifesaving food, secure housing, clean water, healthcare, emergency relief, micro-enterprise
                    projects and education opportunities, we are giving those in extreme poverty a chance at a better
                    future, and showing them God's love. Join us.

                    We know that trees are one of our best natural defences against climate change which is devastating
                    places where people and nature can thrive. We predict that planting and establishing 20 million
                    trees will, at their peak store, around 300,000 tonnes of carbon a year.There's no time to lose. We
                    must plan for the future of woodlands so we can tackle the nature and climate crises together. Plant
                    a tree today and support life for years to come. Help grow the Forest by dedicating a tree. Each
                    ruppee you donate is helping to create woodland habitats that will benefit people and wildlife for
                    years to come. You can plant a tree for yourself, as a gift to someone special or in memory of a
                    loved one. Whichever you choose, you'll help nature to thrive so that future generations can enjoy
                    spending time in the shade of these beautiful giants.

                <p>
                    Every year, some parents struggle to purchase essential school supplies for their children. As a
                    result, children may begin the school year without enough school supplies, which often leaves
                    teachers to fill in the gap. When you donate school supplies, you help students obtain the tools
                    they need to learn throughout the school year. You can also help relieve some of the stress and
                    financial burdens that have consistently fallen on teachers.Education is the only tool by which
                    every child can overcome poverty and enhance their lives. In order to support those children who are
                    poor so, The Giving Tree pays the school fee and distributes books, stationery kits, bags and much
                    more which are required for empowering them to enjoy their right of education. These children are
                    only expecting a small ray of hope.A little contribution from your side can encourage these children
                    to go to school and learn.So please come forward and let's donate in order to make their future
                    bright.

                    Food For The Poor raises funds and provides direct relief assistance to the poor, sometimes by
                    purchasing specifically requested materials and distributing them through the churches and charity
                    organizations already operating in areas of need. We have been providing every day nutritious meals
                    to the slum areas. The hot meals are distributed daily between 1-2pm and include a variety of
                    nutritional foods like steamed cooked rice, dhal, sambhar, mixed vegetable curry, seasonal pickle,
                    Papad etc. This means they no longer have to beg for something that is so readily available to the
                    rest of the world. The plan is to expand this project into other nearby areas as well. By providing
                    nutritious food to the needy people, they recovered from their ill-health easily.The program
                    attempts to eliminate people from begging in slums, who simply can't afford to eat, and ensure a
                    daily worth of nutritious meals. With your kind generous support the needy people can have good
                    nutritious meal and live with dignity.
